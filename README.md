## üóÇÔ∏è Projects
### ü¶† [Multimodal Prostate Cancer Time-To-BCR Predictor](https://github.com/mm-amjad/multimodal-bcr-predictor) <br />
This research project investigates whether combining radiology and histology data through **multimodal deep learning** can improve predictions of time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) following prostatectomy compared to using either data type alone. This project was done using **PyTorch**.

- Foundational models used as encoders to extract embeddings from histology and radiology data
- Evaluation of encoders using a custom built MLP architecture for both modalities, utilising hyperparameter tuning and repeated K-fold cross validation
- Developed intermediate fusion architectures using **cross-attention** and **self-attention**
- Benchmarked the best performing unimodal model versus the best performing multimodal models to explore if combining modalities yield better results for predictions
